This book / repository contains the lecture notes and supplementary materials for the hobby course "Introduction to Formal Mathematics with Lean 4", offered in Fall 2025 at Beijing Institute of Technology.

It is best to download the repository and read it alongside a Lean 4 environment, so that you can try out the code examples and exercises interactively. We maintain an online version of the lecture notes with embedded Lean code if you prefer to read it in your browser. A printed PDF version is also provided as a souvenir, though no special effort has been made to resolve the hyperlinks.

Bibles for further study:

- Mathematics in Lean (MIL): <https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/>

  A comprehensive tutorial for mathematicians to get started with Lean and the mathlib library. Focuses on building up mathematical structures.

- Theorem Proving in Lean 4: <https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/>

  Strong emphasis on logic and dependent type theory. Excellent for both mathematicians and computer scientists.

- Lean Language Manual: <https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/>

  Comprehensive, precise description of Lean: a reference work in which Lean users can look up detailed information, rather than a tutorial intended for new users.

- Type Theory - nLab: <https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type+theory>

  If you want to understand the theoretical foundations of Lean, this is a good place to start.
