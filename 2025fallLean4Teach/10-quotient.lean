# Quotients

After building up the theory of groups, homorphisms, and subgroups,
we are now ready to define quotient groups.

In fact, quotients are so fundamental that
Lean makes them a primitive way of constructing new types.

We shall first illustrate the general quotient construction in Lean,
and then specialize it to quotient groups.

At the end of the journey, we show the first isomorphism theorem for groups as promised.
